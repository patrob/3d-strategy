## FAR Scale
### Factual — “Is it true?”
- 0 — Fabricated
    - Contradicted by credible sources or obvious hoax; no verifiable source; altered media.
- 1 — Rumor
    - Unverified claim, anonymous/social rumor, clickbait headline, no traceable source.
- 2 — Single-source, weak provenance
    - One source with unclear methodology or bias; marketing claims; no primary evidence; conflicts unresolved.
- 3 — Provisionally credible
    - Reported by one reputable outlet or official channel; some primary artifacts/quotes; minor gaps or pending updates.
- 4 — Corroborated
    - Multiple independent reputable sources align; primary docs/data accessible; no substantive counterevidence beyond minor caveats.
- 5 — Strongly verified
    - Multiple independent sources + primary documents/data; transparent methods; expert consensus or official filings; disputes addressed/resolved.

Scoring cues:
- Prefer primary sources (filings, datasets, transcripts) over summaries.
- Independent corroboration ≥ 2 reputable outlets typically pushes to 4+.
- If in doubt, round down.

### Actionable — “Can I act on this?”
- 0 — No action possible
    - Pure FYI; nothing you can do now or in the foreseeable future.
- 1 — Vague/long‑term only
    - Interesting, but requires capabilities/access you don’t have or years‑out shifts.
- 2 — Directional, needs heavy lift
    - Suggests a path, but first step is unclear or blocked by major dependencies/unknowns.
- 3 — Concrete next step exists
    - At least one specific action you can take this week; some ambiguity/dependencies remain.
- 4 — Clear, low‑friction plan
    - Step‑by‑step tasks with owner/time/resource estimate; low dependencies; templates/tools known.
- 5 — Immediate, high‑leverage, within control
    - Ready to start in under 60 minutes; assets at hand; measurable outcome and short feedback loop (≤ 1–2 weeks).

Scoring cues:
- Time horizon: Can you start this week? If yes, ≥ 3.
- Dependency load: Few/none pushes toward 4–5.
- Measurability: Explicit success metric and short loop = 5.

### Relevant — “Do I (or my audience) care?”
- 0 — Off‑topic
    - Unrelated to your brand, audience, or goals.
- 1 — Distantly tangential
    - Tech/industry‑adjacent but outside your lanes; low audience interest.
- 2 — Adjacent/general interest
    - You could comment, but low differentiation or priority right now.
- 3 — On‑theme
    - Fits your core topics; audience likely cares; aligns moderately with current content plan.
- 4 — Core + timely
    - Squarely in your wheelhouse; strong POV; supports an active project/series; timely to publish.
- 5 — Bullseye for you now
    - Directly advances current objectives (newsletter/video/talk); you have unique insight/data; high differentiation and audience demand.

Scoring cues:
- Alignment to current content calendar and goals boosts to 4–5.
- Unique POV or proprietary data pushes higher than generic takes.
- If it helps a live series or near‑term deliverable, don’t score below 4.

Quick examples:
- Factual 5: SEC 10‑K + two independent analyses concur.
- Factual 2: “Leaked memo” from an unverified X account.
- Actionable 5: Script outline ready; record a 5‑min video today; metric = completions.
- Relevant 5: Directly supports this week’s newsletter theme with a unique angle you’ve covered.

### Filter Threshold
Factual must always be a 4 or higher to move forward.
