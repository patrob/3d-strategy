# 3D Strategy for Agentic Engineering

A framework for delivering software at scale using AI coding agents through a disciplined **Discovery > Design > Delivery** approach.

## Overview

This repository documents the 3D Strategy methodology for engineering teams working with AI coding agents. The three-phase approach provides a repeatable discipline for successfully delivering software projects while leveraging the capabilities of modern AI development tools.

**Discovery > Design > Delivery** forms the core framework for:
- Understanding requirements and constraints
- Architecting solutions with AI assistance
- Implementing and deploying with confidence

## What's Included

- Documentation of the 3D Strategy methodology
- *(Coming Soon)* Example prompts and workflows for popular agentic ecosystems:
  - GitHub Copilot
  - Claude Code
  - Gemini CLI
  - Codex CLI
  - Cursor
  - And more

## Documentation Structure

### Core Framework
- **[3D Strategy Phases](docs/phases/README.md)** - Complete guide to Discovery → Design → Delivery
  - [Discovery Phase](docs/phases/Discovery.md) - Build context & insight
  - [Design Phase](docs/phases/Design.md) - Decide what to do & how
  - [Delivery Phase](docs/phases/Delivery.md) - Ship & learn

### Quality Framework
- **[FAR Scale](docs/far-scale/README.md)** - Improve GenAI and human results using Factual, Actionable, Relevant scoring
  - [Generic FAR Scale](docs/far-scale/FAR-Scale-Generic.md) - For research, content, and strategy
  - [Code FAR Scale](docs/far-scale/FAR-Scale-for-Code.md) - For software design and development

## Getting Started

1. Start with the [3D Strategy Phases overview](docs/phases/README.md) to understand the Discovery → Design → Delivery framework
2. Apply the [FAR Scale](docs/far-scale/README.md) to improve the quality of your AI interactions and outputs
3. Explore phase-specific documentation and example prompts for your preferred AI coding environment
